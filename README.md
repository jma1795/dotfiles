# Configs and DOT files for my various computers and systems

System setup and configs for my linux systems. I have a few hanging around but I try to leave their configs here as I can.

Compatability: Linux Mint (Typically Cinnamon Desktop) or LMDE
#Folder Structure:
Config - any non-specific configuration files that I might need
Tools - any tools that I plan to use. I will eventually include any setup scripts I use on a non-public git repo here once they are of "good" quality
Scripts - basically anything I've aquired or written myself to do certain tasks I need. It is a mixture of things so I won't take full credit

Any folders for specific machines are the configs I currently use for these systems are simply labled as such.
